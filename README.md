# MERN Authentication

This repository provides a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) authentication template for building secure web applications with user authentication. It includes a frontend built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Bootstrap for a responsive user interface, and a backend server built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for data storage, bcrypt.js for password hashing, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

## Features

- User registration with email and password
- User login with email and password
- Password hashing using bcrypt.js for enhanced security
- Token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Protected routes to restrict access to authenticated users
